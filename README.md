You can use the starter package for faster setup process of [Gatsby Storefront](https://github.com/GatsbyStorefront/gatsby-theme-storefront-shopify).

```sh
gatsby new store gatsbystorefront/gatsby-starter-storefront-shopify
```

This downloads the files and initializes the site by running npm install.

Please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/GatsbyStorefront/gatsby-theme-storefront-shopify) of `gatsby-theme-storefront-shopify`.
